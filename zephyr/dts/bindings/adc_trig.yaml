description : This node is used to set adc triggers and sync it with power legs.

compatible : "adc-trig"

properties :

    current-pin-num :
      type : int
      required : true
      description : Current mode is used to control the output current. We use a comparator 
                    and DAC generation for slope compensation. The availability of the current
                    mode depends on the pin connected to the current measure. 
                    Below you can see every possible pin. Choose 0 if no pin is required. 

      # +----------+-----------------+

    default-adc-trigger :
      type : string
      required : true
      description : Which adc trigger is used for data acquisition (only two leg can support it), 
                    if this leg isn't suposed to trigger the adc choose ADCTRIG_NONE.
      enum :
      - "ADCTRIG_NONE"
      - "ADCTRIG_1"
      - "ADCTRIG_2"
      - "ADCTRIG_3"
      - "ADCTRIG_4"

    default-edge-trigger :
      type : string
      required : true
      description : Only relevant in Center aligned. Choose when ADC is triggered, 
                    either when the counter is counting up, counting down or both. 
                    Keep EdgeTrigger_up as a default
      enum :
      - "EdgeTrigger_up"
      - "EdgeTrigger_down"
      - "EdgeTrigger_Both"

    default-adc-decim :
      type : int
      required : true
      description : The timer unit will trigger the ADC at the switching frequency, 
                    but you can divide this frequency with the number set by adc-decim 
                    (between 1 and 32). adc-decim = 2 means that the frequency of
                    the trigger is divided by 2. Keep adc-decim = 1 as default.
